# 253. 会议室 II
# 给你一个会议时间安排的数组 intervals ，每个会议时间都会包括开始和结束的时间 intervals[i] = [starti, endi] ，为避免会议冲突，同时要考虑充分利用会议室资源，请你计算至少需要多少间会议室，才能满足这些会议安排。
#
#
#
# 示例 1：
#
# 输入：intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]
# 输出：2
# 示例 2：
#
# 输入：intervals = [[7,10],[2,4]]
# 输出：1
#
#
# 提示：
#
# 1 <= intervals.length <= 104
# 0 <= starti < endi <= 106
